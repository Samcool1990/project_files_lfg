#Question: Given a positiove integer n. Write a recurssive function to print number from -n to n.
# Answer:
def print_numbers(n, current=None):
    if current is None:
        current = -n  # Initialize starting point

    # Base case: If current exceeds n, stop recursion
    if current > n:
        return

    # Print current number
    print(current)

    # Recursive call with incremented current value
    print_numbers(n, current + 1)

# Example usage
n = 5
print_numbers(n)
