# what is the differenc between == & === in JS
# The == operator performs a loose equality comparison that performs type coercion if necessary to make the 
# comparison possible. The === operator, on the other hand, performs a strict equality comparison that does 
# not perform type coercion and requires the operands to have the same type (as well as the same value).
