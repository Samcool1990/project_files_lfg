#Question: Orders:
# Orders:
# orderid, customerid, date(yyyy-mm-dd) 
# Oder_Details:
# orderid, unirprice, quantity
# find the customerid who has the most amount of orders.
# output should be yyyy, mm, customerid, totalamountordered
# Note: orderid is linked with both tables.


# Answer: 
# SELECT
#     YEAR(o.date) AS yyyy,
#     MONTH(o.date) AS mm,
#     o.customerid,
#     SUM(od.unitprice * od.quantity) AS totalamountordered
# FROM
#     Orders o
# JOIN
#     Order_Details od
# ON
#     o.orderid = od.orderid
# GROUP BY
#     YEAR(o.date),
#     MONTH(o.date),
#     o.customerid
# ORDER BY
#     yyyy, mm, totalamountordered DESC
# LIMIT 1;
